# Personal Links (as Tiles) solution

## 📝 Description
This solution provides a functionality which may be added to any SharePoint page (as full webpart page as well) or as personal app in teams and teams tab, which store user defined links (urls to sites) in a nice kind of Spfx webpart that present them as tiles (like apps 😋). For now this repo has only the webpart that present the user personal links as tiles (the user may of course add them and edit them etc.). [Webpart](https://github.com/Adam-it/TilesLinksForSPOnline/tree/master/Webpart). 

In future I want to extend this with extensions for sites and lists that will allow to add a personal link from any point of SharePoint and with some kind of admin app (maybe some console application or other 🤔) which will allow to add not removable links for other users by the company. 

This kind of solution gives an another personalized navigation for an Intranet portal which the users may create themselves.
